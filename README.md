# Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique to optimize web applications as well as on mobile apps. There are some components the user might not need initially or ever and rendering those components harms applicationâ€™s performance especially when there are a lot of images to be shown.

This is an app that demonstrates lazy loading in a React app (folder **react-app**). The backend is a Node app that emulates real case with pagination and feeds the client from **data.json** file.

In this demo you can see the moment when _bottom of the page reached!_ is printed in browsers console. This is the moment when the React app calls server to gett data for a new set of products to show.

Fetching new data function is triggered reaching the botton of the page.

```javascript
//section of code from /reacr-app/src/components/List.js
  componentDidMount() {
    window.addEventListener("scroll", this.onScroll, false);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    window.removeEventListener("scroll", this.onScroll, false);
  }

  onScroll = async () => {
    if (
      window.innerHeight + window.scrollY >= document.body.offsetHeight - 500 &&
      this.props.list.length &&
      !this.state.isLoading
    ) {
      console.log("bottom of the page reached!");
      this.setState({ isLoading: true });
      await this.props.paginatedSearch();
      this.setState({ isLoading: false });
    }
  };
```

This app gets 10 new products every time whe user scrolls to the end if list of renedered products. That can be changed in **LandingPage.js** file.

```javascript
//section of code from /reacr-app/src/components/LandingPage.js
const URL = "http://localhost:3001";
const NUMBER_OF_PRODUCTS_PER_PAGE = 10;
```

If you want to play with this app, clone it and run two apps, server and client. Of course you must do _npm install_ before that.
